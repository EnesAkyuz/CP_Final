## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

We had a pretty solid workflow and task seperation, everyone worked on their own tasks and things went pretty smooth in terms of completion. Design wise, we had the time to learn some new tools, so, that was a helpful addition to the skillset. Overall, it was pretty efficient week.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

Scoping the application was a big challenge. We still are not sure if we are going to be able to implement all of the features fully within 4 weeks. However, we are going to try to build an MVP at least, that will make things work out well enough! I hope we can be successful! Other than that, there were not many challenges except that we did not have any designer in the team, so, one of us needed to learn design tools.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

Maybe support in terms of learning how to implement one of the key features of markdown commenting would be extremely nice. Since it is a cool concept but I am not sure how we are going to implement it. Other than that, the file sharing and privilege systems would use some advice too.
