## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

I think all of us agree that we worked very efficiently and completed the task quite fast. Everyone had a lot of ideas, and we discussed thoroughly on which idea we should pursue. We tried to cover most of the user stories and make them as clear as possible so that we have a clear vision of the application. We also tried to take from an existing idea and mold it to a new one so we do not have concerns if the idea is "feasible" or can be implemented.

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

The main challenge was scheduling, since most of our schedules were quite different. Everyone was in a different timezone and our class times were not very compatible. However, despite this hurdle, we managed to meet up a couple of times and work asynchronously for the rest of it. Another challenge was clearly translating the user stories into features. However, I think we covered all of the grounds that we mentioned in the user stories as features. Maybe we can break down the features further, but we are pleased with the current mapping of them as well.

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

I think we might need a bit more clearer deployment instructions. Also for authentication and group formation within the app, a small tutorial or experience would be really useful. Since building auth is one thing, but having a visibility tier is another thing. So, we might need a bit of support in that sense.
